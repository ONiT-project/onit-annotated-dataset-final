# ONiT: Annotated Dataset Final Version

This is the updated version of our annotated image dataset extracted from the travelogues corpus, which was analized in context of the [Ottoman Nature in Travelogues (ONiT) project](https://onit.oeaw.ac.at/)). In total, we extracted 22,299 images from a corpus of about 15,000 travelogues. Many of them were previously unknown to research, albeit this not only included mimetic representations relevant to the project, but also printerâ€™s marks and paratextual additions as well as artifacts from the digitization process that the [Illustration Detector](https://gitlab.com/vgg/nls-chapbooks-illustrations/-/tree/master) used for the automatic extraction of the images detected as images. 

We included multi-label annotations in [ICONCLASS](https://iconclass.org/) of all nature representations identified in the images, comprising animals, plants, landscapes, and maps. In total, we annotated 5,713 representations of plants or vegetation (26% of all extracted images), 4,252 landscapes (20% of all extracted images), 3,517 animals (16% of all extracted images), and 1,084 maps (5% of all extracted images). As the animal class contained notably heterogeneous features, we created more detailed annotations within it. This resulted in 21,793 annotations of flora, fauna, landscapes, maps, and individual animal classes (in total 68 annotated classes).

A collection of direct links leading to the extracted images at the Austrian National Library IIIF repository are provided in the CSV/Excel files. However, the links were created during the first project year based on the IIIF image link and the coordinates of the identified images provided by the Illustration Detector. Since then, some of the books that we harvested were updated; thus, in some cases, the direct links to the original image source do not point to the correct identified image anymore. Therefore, the direct IIIF links should be used with caution. We will provide a dump of the extracted images to be downloaded shortly.

This repository contains:
* A CSV/Xcel file listing all images that we have extracted and, where identified, the annotations of nature classes present on the image (ONiT_extracted-images_singleEditions_wAnnotations_2025-01-28);
* A CSV/Xcel file listing all images with nature representations from the corpus with the ICONCLASS notations (ONiT_D16-L19_multi-label_detailed_2025-01-28).
